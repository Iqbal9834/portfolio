## Getting Started
You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed, and you'll need to be somewhat familiar with your computer's command line.

## How To Use
First, from your command line, clone the repository and navigate into it. You'll also need to remove my version as the remote origin.
```
git clone 

cd 

git remote remove origin
```

Next, you need to install the dependencies. This can be done using either NPM or Yarn.
`npm install` OR `yarn install`

Once the installation is complete, run either `npm start` or `yarn start` to get your local copy running. This should also open a preview of the template in your default browser, at an address of `http://localhost:8080/`, or something similar. 

## Template Instructions

### Step 1: Replace the images.

Open the project folder in Finder or whatever your machine's file explorer is called. Navigate to /src/img/. There, you will see five images. Delete them all, and then add your own, with the following criteria: 

- Add to the folder an image of yourself with the background removed, and cropped to a square shape. This will make the image look best with the template. I recommend using https://www.remove.bg/ to remove the background. If the image is very wide or very tall, crop it using your machine's built-in image editor so that it is mostly square. When you add this to the `img` folder, be sure to rename the file `self.png`. 
- Next, add to the folder as many screenshots of your projects as you would like. This can either be a singular image of the site, or you can make mockups like the one below in Canva, Photoshop, Gimp, etc. Feel free to email/DM me at any of my socials if you want help making something similar:

- Rename all of your project image files to "mock1.png", "mock2.png", "mock3.png", etc. for as many as you have, starting with 1 and going in order. 

### Step 2: Edit the `info.js` file. 
Next, open the template directory in your code editor. Navigate to `/src/Info/Info.js`. There are some instructions written in the comments there, but I'll go over everything here as well. 

#### 2a: Pick your color scheme.
Near the top of the `Info.js` file, you will see the following line:
```
export let colors = ["rgb(185, 85, 211)", "rgb(247, 10, 7)"];
```
These are the colors used to determine the "accents" throughout the site -- the circle behind your self portrait, the color of your name, the buttons on the Portfolio page, and the labels on the About page. 

You can pick any colors you like for this, but I reccomend using this [gradient generator](https://paytonjewell.github.io/gradient-generator/) to play around and find colors that look good together. When you've found a combination you like, copy the first rgb code from the bottom of the gradient generator and paste it to replace the first value of the `colors` array in `Info.js`. Then, do the same with the second rgb code from the gradient generator. When you're done, save the file, and take a look at your local Live Server -- the colors on the homepage should have changed to the new colors you added. Be sure to play around a bit with toggling Dark Mode to make sure your colors look the way you want them to in both modes. 

#### 2b: Edit your information.
Going further down the `Info.js` file, you will see a big group of text that starts with `export const info = {`. Begin replacing this information with your information, such as the firstName, lastName, initials, position, etc. Some of the values should remain unchanged -- pay attention to the comments in the file. 

If you're not sure how to get emojis for the miniBio and hobbies, on Mac you should be able to access the emoji keyboard with `control`+`command`+`space`. Otherwise, use [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) to find and copy-paste what you like. 

For the 'socials' section, be sure to replace the links with your own social profile links. 

For the 'portfolio' section, update the titles to whatever you want. The `liveLink` should be a link to the live demo of your project. The `sourceLink` should be a link to the repository where the *code* of the project is hosted, such as GitHub. 

Note: If you have more than 4 projects, you will need to add more objects to the portfolio array. Just copy from the opening bracket to the comma of *one* object and continue pasting as many as you need. If you need help with this, feel free to reach out. 

And that's it! If you save the file and check your live server, you should see that the information has been updated and the portfolio has been customized. 

## Deployment
*Please Note: I'm only going to be including instructions for deployment to Github Pages right now.*
